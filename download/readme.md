## Download

For the moment, the project Open Macro Input is maintained by Éloi Strée and the business model is not defined.

You have several way to download the software:
- download an old version from sample, demo or a friend
- download third party app on the GitHub release sections
- download the current in developement version for my [Patreon](patreon.com/eloistree) and [Tipeee](https://en.tipeee.com/eloistree/)


As developer of OMI, all my public work is available on a shared Mega.nz disk and on GitHub.   
You can donate to have a centrelized access to my projects.    
The alternative is to browse around on GitHub for the project you are looking for.
