# About

Hello and welcome.

Open Macro input is the concept of easy the communication between humans and machines. We try to do that by remapping and giving access of Macro to the community. 

Where can you find information about the project ?  

You can read more about on the landing page:

Open Macro Input is a concept but as I am a solo developer that want to design some applications that will be use by 1.000 - 300.000, it means that the project will need to evolve at some point as a small company (ASBL).
